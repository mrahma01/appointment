==========================
Tangent Django Boilerplate
==========================

This is a boilerplate README.rst created from the `tangent-django-boilerplate`_ project.
This section should be deleted and the below sections completed when the project
is created.

.. _`tangent-django-boilerplate`: https://github.com/tangentlabs/tangent-django-boilerplate

Use this project with Django 1.4's ``startproject`` command::

    django-admin.py startproject $PROJECT_NAME --extensions="py,rst,conf,wsgi" --template=https://github.com/tangentlabs/tangent-django-boilerplate/zipball/master

Note that you need to specify a name for the project and pass the following variables:

* ``client`` - The client for this project

* ``project_code`` - The project code

* ``domain`` - The top-level domain for the test/stage sites and the alerts mailing list

* ``timezone`` - Which timezone to use in ``settings.py``

Tangent developers can use the `tangent-kickstart`_ tool to simplify creation
of projects that conform to our conventions:

.. _`tangent-kickstart`: https://github.com/tangentlabs/tangent-kickstart

The below copy will contains template variables - it gets merged with a context
when a new boilerplate project is created.
